# CS-121-PA-6
The purpose of the PA6 is to Write a program that simulates the game of Battleship. The game
will be completely text-based (see Sample Execution). Battleship is a two player Navy game. The objective
of the game is to sink all ships in your enemy's fleet. The Player to sink his/her enemy's fleet first wins.
Both players' fleets consist of 5 ships that are hidden from the enemy. Each ship may be differentiated by
its "size" (besides the Cruiser and Submarine) or number of cells it expands on the game board. The Carrier
has 5 cells, Battleship has 4 cells, Cruiser has 3 cells, Submarine has 3 cells, and the Destroyer has 2 cells.
